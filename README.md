# website
https://www.matthewhu.com


still todos:
- get better projects (launch spotify, maybe have 2 sections for projects)
- add picture of myself



What I would like to add on version 2.0:
- Loading effect, to indicate that the website is loading
- instead of up + down and sidebar left and right
- footer is just link to portfolio github
- When scrolling down, navbar hides to top. scroll up reappears
